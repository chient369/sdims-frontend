# FE-CORE-009: Authorization Components Implementation

## Components Implemented

1. **PrivateRoute**: A component that protects routes based on authentication state, permissions, and roles.
   - Path: `src/components/auth/PrivateRoute.tsx` and enhanced `src/features/auth/routes.tsx`
   - Features: Authentication check, permission check, role check, redirect to login/unauthorized

2. **AuthGuard**: A component that conditionally renders children based on permissions and roles.
   - Path: `src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx`
   - Features: Permission-based rendering, role-based rendering, fallback content

3. **usePermissions**: A custom hook for permission and role checking.
   - Path: `src/hooks/usePermissions.tsx`
   - Features: Convenient permission and role checking functions

4. **withPermissions**: A Higher Order Component (HOC) for permission-based component rendering.
   - Path: `src/components/auth/withPermissions.tsx`
   - Features: Wraps components with permission/role checks

5. **PermissionButton**: A button component that is automatically disabled when users lack required permissions.
   - Path: `src/components/auth/PermissionButton.tsx`
   - Features: Permission-based enabling/disabling, optional hiding

6. **UnauthorizedPage**: A page component shown when users lack required permissions.
   - Path: `src/components/auth/UnauthorizedPage.tsx`
   - Features: Customizable error message, navigation buttons

## Documentation

- Comprehensive usage examples available in `src/components/auth/README.md`
- Comments and JSDoc added to all components

## Integration with Existing Codebase

- Enhanced the existing PrivateRoute in `src/features/auth/routes.tsx` with role-based protection
- Ensured compatibility with the existing routing system
- Created index exports for easy importing

## Features

- **Route Protection**: Prevent unauthorized access to protected routes
- **UI Component Protection**: Show/hide UI elements based on permissions
- **Permission Utilities**: Easy-to-use hooks and HOCs for permission checking
- **Role-based Access Control**: Support for both permission and role-based protection
- **Scope Awareness**: Support for permission scopes (all, team, own)
- **Fallback Content**: Option to show alternative content when permission is denied

## Usage Examples

See `src/components/auth/README.md` for detailed usage examples of all components.

## Next Steps

1. Add these authorization components to all routes and UI elements that require permission checks
2. Update feature pages to use the appropriate permission checks
3. Consider adding audit logging for important actions that are subject to permissions
